# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Classification
Machine Learning Minor Project

This project aims to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, the project involves:

Loading the Dataset: Utilizing the Keras API to load the MNIST dataset, which includes 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
Data Preprocessing: Scaling pixel values and reshaping images to fit the CNN input requirements.
Building the CNN Model: Constructing a CNN with convolutional, max-pooling, flattening, and dense layers using TensorFlow.
Training the Model: Training the CNN on the training dataset over multiple epochs.
Evaluating and Predicting: Assessing the model's performance on the test dataset and making predictions.
The project demonstrates a complete workflow for digit classification, from data handling to model evaluation, leveraging deep learning techniques in a structured and interactive Jupyter Notebook environment.
